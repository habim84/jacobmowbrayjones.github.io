Tamagotchi Project Outline

Overall: 
The goal of this project is to use Javascript to make a persistent Tamagotchi. 

Big Challenges:

1.Using Javascript to make a state machine that is easy to update. 
The initial three states will be hungry, tired, and needy. 
The code should be flexible enough that adding playful or sad will be easy. 

2. To make the Tamagotchi persistent.

3. Allow multiple users


Small Challenges:


 4. Animating the Tamagotchi using jQuery


5. Interacting with the Tamagotchi.

6. Host on a site other than Github

Steps for 1:


1. Create a basic enum based state machine with the three target states. 


2.  Create a weighted system to randomlyish choose between what the next state will be.For now state can be expressed in console log or in text.


3. Add buttons that change the weights. 
For instance “give food” “play with” “sing a lullaby to” will
change the weights for hunger, tiredness and loneliness. 


4. State machine triggers proper animation


Steps for 3.


1. Have input boxes that can read and edit a text file(CSV) and/or xml file. 


2. Prompt boxes for new user and password.


3. A simple text box that responds based on new user, incorrect password, welcome back...etc.
